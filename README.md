## This project is creating a script which allows the user to input their workspace, csv file, their output and what ESPG they will be using. 

For more information regarding how to use this script please read through the Project 2 Notebook. Once you have your variables you can use the script in ArcGIS to create a map which shows the points from you CSV and you can set the symbology to represent different elevations.
